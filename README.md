## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Dynamically render pages on the server for better SEO and faster initial load times.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pre-render pages at build time for improved performance.
- **API Routes:** Build serverless API endpoints directly within the application.
- **Font Optimization:** Uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to optimize and load fonts like [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) seamlessly.
- **Hot Reloading:** Automatically updates the application in the browser as you edit files.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Project Structure

- **`app/page.tsx`:** The main entry point for the application. You can modify this file to update the homepage.
- **`public/`:** A folder for static assets like images, icons, and other files.
- **`styles/`:** Contains global and modular CSS files for styling the application.

## Development Workflow

1. **Edit and Save:** Modify any file in the `app/` directory to see live updates in the browser.
2. **Add Features:** Use Next.js features like API routes or dynamic routing to expand the application.
3. **Optimize:** Leverage built-in tools like image optimization and font loading for better performance.
